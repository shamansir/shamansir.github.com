        <em>At work,</em> I am <abbr title="Java Platform, Enterprise Edition" class="tech-name">Java EE</abbr>/Web&nbsp;developer.

        I like to develop client side: UI controls, visual representation of the server
        data, server to client (and back) data transfer and everything connected with that.

        Because of this, I am also experienced in <span class="tech-name">JavaScript</span>
        (with <span class="tech-name">JQuery</span> usage or without)
        and <abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" class="tech-name">AJAX</abbr>
        technologies (<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language" class="tech-name">XML</abbr>/<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation" class="tech-name">JSON</abbr> included).

        I like <span class="tech-name">Java</span> for its considered strictness and serious,
        technological approach.

        I&nbsp;also pay respect to <a href="http://webstandards.org" class="tech-name">Web Standards</a>.

        <span class="tech-name">Web standards</span> are just really helping people, both
        users and developers.

        They're not rules â€” but it's really good if you follow the most of them.

        <span class="tech-name">JavaScript</span> in its current condition is the Web language
        with its own culture, now it is an easy language to do dynamic and fun things on
        the pages.

        Of course, my skills is not limited with described ones, but these enumerated are the perfect :).

        <em>At home,</em> I like everything connected to
        <abbr title="Computer Graphics">CG</abbr>.

        I like to use just Open Source software, so my OS is
        preferably <del><span class="tech-name">Linux</span>/<span class="tech-name">Ubuntu</span><sup class="ref">*</sup></del> MacOS X.
        I also do really like <span class="tech-name">github</span> philosophy.

        You can scroll through <a href="http://shamansir.tumblr.com">my blog</a> (or <a href="http://shamansir-ru.tumblr.com">in Russian</a>, there are much more articles there)
        to see what I've developed and what I am interested in.

        I'm training my skills in my favorite programming language
        <span class="tech-name">Python</span>, in <span class="tech-name">Android</span> development and in Web development
        at&nbsp;the same&nbsp;time. There is
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sametimed/" title="Sametimed Project">
        'sametimed' project</a> in progress, written in
        <span class="tech-name">Java</span>, that uses
        <span class="tech-name">Google Wave Protocol</span> in its kernel. Also I have written
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimeoid/" title="Vimeoid Project">'vimeoid' project</a> for <span class="tech-name">Android</span>,
        but it will not be finished. Anyway, you can see the examples of my code there.

        Also, I have several more <span class="tech-name">Java</span>/<span class="tech-name">JavaScript</span>
        projects, they're hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/u/shaman.sir/" title="shaman.sir: profile at googlecode">my profile at <span class="tech-name">googlecode</span></a>.
        Another bunch of projects-in-progress is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/shamansir/" title="shamansir: profile at github">my profile at <span class="tech-name">github</span></a>.
